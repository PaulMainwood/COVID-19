**Visualising the spread of the pandemic**.<br><br>
[English LA Heatmaps.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/English%20LA%20Heatmaps.R) generates heatmaps and animated maps showing English Upper Tier Local Authority trajectories in both confirmed COVID-19 cases and estimated COVID-19 deaths (in hospitals only) inspired by similar plots for US states from [@Marco_Piani](https://twitter.com/Marco_Piani). The approach to modelling deaths, which are only published at NHS trust level, was developed by [@Benj_Barr](https://twitter.com/Benj_Barr). The code also generates a map of Local Authority-level changes in case numbers in the past week and animated maps of both case and death counts.<br><br>
[COVIDCaseCartograms.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDCaseCartograms.R) creates a series of cartograms based on [the excellent templates](https://t.co/rIej2uTt5D) created by [@carlbaker](https://twitter.com/carlbaker) showing COVID case rates across the UK.<br><br>
[COVIDVaccinations.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDVaccinations.R) creates graphs of the UK rollout of COVID vaccines, while [COVIDVaccinationMSOACartogram](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDVaccinationMSOACartogram.R) plots maps of the geographic distribution of vaccinations in England and analyses the socioeconomic inequalities in this. [COVIDMSOACaseRatexIMD.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDMSOACaseRatexIMD.R) looks at socioeconomic differences in case rates and how they have changed in recent weeks, while [COVIDBivariateCasesxIMD](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDBivariateCasesxIMD.R) looks at associations between COVID case rates and deprivation in London and Glasgow.<br><br>
[COVIDNHSAdmissions.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDNHSAdmissions.R) analyses hospital admissions, occupancy and ventilator bed use across England. [UK Hex Animation.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/UK%20Hex%20Animations.R) uses this data to generate an animated hex map of COVID-19 cases across the UK & Ireland, built on various excellent hex map resources from [@ODILeeds](https://twitter.com/ODILeeds) and [@olihawkins](https://twitter.com/olihawkins).<br><br>
[COVIDLACaseData.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDLACaseData.R) generates similar outputs, including for hospital admissions, at Lower Tier Local Authority level. I've written about these plots in [an article](https://t.co/zNCrpC0wMw?amp=1) for the journal [People, Place and Policy](https://extra.shu.ac.uk/ppp-online/). [COVIDTestingData.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDTestingData.R) analyses testing rates and positivity, although this analysis is now less relevant since the wider rollout of LFD tests, as it mostly focuses on PCR test data.<br><br>
[Scottish HB Heatmaps.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/Scottish%20HB%20Heatmaps.R), [Welsh LA Heatmaps.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/Welsh%20LA%20Heatmaps.R), [Irish County Heatmaps.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/Irish%20County%20Heatmaps.R), [German State Heatmaps.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/German%20State%20Heatmaps.R) and [COVIDCanadaHeatmap.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDCanadaHeatmap.R) produce equivalent case trajectory plots for Scottish Health Boards, Welsh Local Authorities, Irish Counties, German Bundesl√§nder and Canadian Provinces respectively.<br><br>
[COVIDCycle.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDCycle.R) visualises data on COVID-19 hospital admissions and deaths (using deaths within 24 days of a positive test, rathern than death certificate data) using [an approach](https://twitter.com/maartenzam/status/1319622943526293505) taken from [Maarten Lambrechts](https://twitter.com/maartenzam). [COVIDCycleUS](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDCycle_US.R) produces similar plots for the US as a whole and for individual states.<br><br>
[COVIDPHESurveillance.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDPHESurveillance.R) and [COVIDPHESurveillance2.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDPHESurveillance2.R) provide analysis of the PHE Surveillance reports, including case data and positivity rates by age, although these have largely been replaced by [COVIDPHECasesxAgev2](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDPHECasesxAgev2.R) which generates similar plots now that age-specific case data at Local Authority level is published as part of [the PHE dashboard](http://coronavirus.data.gov.uk). [ONSInfectionSurvey](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/ONSInfectionSurvey.R) produces similar graphs for the ONS' random sampling infection survey. [ScotlandCOVIDCasesxAge.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/ScotlandCOVIDCasesxAge.R) performs some similar analysis of case data by age for Scotland, alongside analysis of cases and deaths by deprivation quintile. [COVIDAgeTrends.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDAgeTrends.R) takes data on COVID cases, admissions and deaths and separates the trends out by age, to help identify potential impacts of the vaccination programme.<br><br>
[ScotlandCOVIDHouseParties.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/ScotlandCOVIDHouseParties.R) is a small piece of analysis looking at data from Scotland on regulation-breaching house parties. Finally, [COVIDPillars.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/COVIDPillars.R) is another, obsolete, approach using older, pre-dashboard API, data to separate out case trajectories by testing pillar, while [Misc Case Analysis.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Heatmaps/Misc%20Case%20Analysis.R) is a collection of various quick plots related to various aspects of case data.<br><br>
I've also made a few apps to allow you to explore local and national COVID-19 data. [One](https://victimofmaths.shinyapps.io/COVID_LA_Plots/) for mortality, cases and admissions data, [one](https://victimofmaths.shinyapps.io/COVID_Cases_By_Age/) for case data stratified by age and [another](https://victimofmaths.shinyapps.io/COVID_Case_Trends_By_Age/) which compares trends in recent age-specific case data.
